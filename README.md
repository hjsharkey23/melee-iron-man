A randomizer for the 'Iron Man' game mode in Super Smash Brothers Melee

'Iron Man' is a community created game mode in which 2-4 players face off against each other and must
beat their opponent with a pre determined number of characters, one at a time. You cannot move on from your current character until you beat your opponent with that character. The game is over when one pkayer wins with the final character. Typically you see 8 character Iron Man's and the full 26 character variation.

Traditionally 'Iron Man' characters would be determined by starting on one side of the character selection screen, working your way left to right, then left to right in a snake formation. Your opponent would start at the opposite side of the character selection screen in reverse.

This is okay to do if you don't play iron man very often. However Twitch streamers, and top Melee players, Mango and Axe, have popularized iron man by doing a weekly event on stream called 'Mango Axe Wednesdays' in which they face off in a 26 character Iron Man match.

There have been over 40 Mango Axe Wednesdays to date, and one even was featured as an event at the prestigious 'Smash Summit' tournament series that will often seee viewers upwards of 100,000.

They play so much that they needed to start randomizing the character order in order to create unique matchups for the viewers to enjoy. Without a randomizer, the Iron Man becomes more predictable, and loses its 'fun' factor that viewers emjoy.

This web application aims to make a user friendly way to randomize however many characters you would like and display them to you.
